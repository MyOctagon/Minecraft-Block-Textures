# Minecraft-Block-Textures
A repository of all minecraft block renders and items textures (Incomplete and being updated)

It is hard to find the blockrenders of minecraft blocks (Cube Texture that is found n the inventory). So I made a collection of the renders I found online.
Most of these textures are downloaded from Minecraft Gamepedia except some textures which I couldn't find there. Feel free to use them as these are Creative Commons Lisenced.

# Things you can find here:
- 3D Block renders
- Item textures

# Contributing
Feel free to contribute here, I really apreciate that. As I said this repository is still incomplete and missing a lot of textures. If you find any missing texture, feel free to add it. If you think some thing is not organized properly them you can restucture the folders. There might be duplicate textures if you find them please remove them.
### Few things to note before contributing
- This is NOT a repository of plain textures is blocks
- This IS a repository of 3D block renders
- This IS a repository of item textures
- File names must include the name of block/item (If it is downloaded from Minecraft Gamepedia then it doesn't need renaming)

Happy Crafting :)
